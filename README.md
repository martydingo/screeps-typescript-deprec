# Screeps Typescript

This repository is a repository of screeps code, organised into their respective branches.

You'll find the live code here on the `production` branch, where it can be noted that there are no commits directly into this branch, other then this README.

This repository is used in conjuction with `Coder`, `Terraform` and `Kubernetes`, with each branch corresponding to the name of each different development instance created by `Coder`.

With a bit of luck, this allows seperation between development, beta, and production environments, with clear lines of isolation, and allowing multiple, differing instances within each environment.
